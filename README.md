# ML Project

## Project Title
Predictive Health Diagnosis System

## Project Description
This machine learning project aims to develop a system that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The system will ask users about their symptoms and use a trained machine learning model to predict possible diseases. This project will leverage data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithms to provide accurate health diagnostics.

## Features
- **User Interface:** Simple and interactive interface to input symptoms.
- **Disease Prediction:** Utilizes machine learning models to predict diseases based on input symptoms.
- **Data Handling:** Efficient handling and processing of user input data.
- **Model Training:** Uses datasets of symptoms and diseases to train the model.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - Flask (for web interface)
- **Database:** SQLite for storing user input and model data
